Answer = 12/51

A deck has 52 cards, with 4 sets. Each set has 13 cards.
We draw one card, whatever suit it is. No we are left with 51 cards.
So, in order for second card to be of similar set, we need to pick from (13-1 = 12) cards.
And total cards left in the deck are: (52-1=51)
Hence, 12/51 is the probability.
